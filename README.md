Space Meow is a Top/Down shooter game.
In this game the player incarnates a cat in a spaceship that is trapped in an asteroid field. The player will have to shoot and dodge the asteroids to keep himself out 
of trouble as long as possible !

Destroying asteroids grants the player points that increase his overall score. Different bonuses will randomly spawn in order to help them survive longer and get 
a higher score.
