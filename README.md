Space Meow is a Top/Down shooter game.
In this game the player takes the role of a cat in a spaceship that is trapped in an asteroid field. It includes two modes :  
  
  ENDLESS : The player will have to shoot and dodge the asteroids to keep themselves out of trouble as long as possible !
  
  STORY : The player has to reach a certain amount of points in order to trigger a bossfight.

Destroying asteroids grants the player points that increase their overall score. Different bonuses will randomly spawn in order to help them survive longer and get 
a higher score.
